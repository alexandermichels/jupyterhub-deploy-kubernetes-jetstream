Configuration of HTTPS issuer
=============================

After having installed `cert-manager`, see tutorial at:

<https://zonca.dev/2020/03/setup-https-kubernetes-letsencrypt.html>

install `https_issuer.yml`.

Instead if `cert-manager` was installed as part of Kubespray,
use `https_issuer_kubespray.yml`.
